# My mouseless dev environment
Here I have all my mouseless configuration for unix systems to reuse in any computer (not windows
sorry). All the parts are configurable on your own, feel free to choose your own zsh theme and add
more plugins on top of it.

***The minimalist basic tools I use in my daily basis:***
- Vim
- Tmux
- ZSH (on top of Oh my zsh framework)
- (fzf,ripgrep,lsd, batcat)
